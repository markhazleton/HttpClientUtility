/// - Controlling the maximum degree of parallelism
/// - Tracking progress and duration of individual requests
/// - Preserving request metadata through the concurrent execution
/// - Managing cancellation and error handling across all concurrent operations
/// 
/// This processor inherits from the generic ConcurrentProcessor&lt;T&gt; and specializes it
/// for HTTP client operations using HttpRequestResult for tracking request/response data.
